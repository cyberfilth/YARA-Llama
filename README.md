YARA Llama requires YARA to be installed, it's a simple front-end that allows you to select a directory of .yar scripts when analysing potential malware.
The YARA Forensics repo at <https://github.com/Xumeiquer/yara-forensics> is a good source of scripts.

This version of YARA Llama currently only works on Linux, it can be downloaded from the releases page.

[Download the Linux version here](https://github.com/cyberfilth/YARA-Llama/releases/download/0.4/YLlama-Linux.zip)
